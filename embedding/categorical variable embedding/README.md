# Categorical Variable Embedding

The example notebook here is to learn embeddings representation for categorical variables.

```
categorical variable -> one-hot-encoding -> embedding by fitting target variables -> obtain embedding weights
```

The work code and content follows [Learning embeddings for your machine learning model](https://medium.com/spikelab/learning-embeddings-for-your-machine-learning-model-a6cb4bc6542e).
